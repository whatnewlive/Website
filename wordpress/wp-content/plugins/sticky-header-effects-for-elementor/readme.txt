== Installation ==

### ☑️ How to Install Sticky Header Effects for Elementor in 3 Easy Steps

1. Make sure Elementor (Free or Pro) is installed and activated.
2. Install the **Sticky Header Effects for Elementor** plugin from the WordPress plugin repository.
3. Open any page with Elementor → Select a container or section → Go to the **Advanced Tab** → Enable Sticky Header Settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

** Why isn't the "shrink" effect working? **

The header cannot shrink smaller than the objects inside of it!

The "shrink" effect is restricted by the size of the content in the header section. Such as logos, images, menus, widgets, and also all of the padding and margins of those elements. This also inclused the padding and margins of the sections and columns themselves.

To get the best "shrink" effect use these settings:
* Set the top and bottom padding to 0px on your sticky header section, column, and elements inside of it.
* Set a custom logo and other image height(you can leave the width blank for "auto").
* Set the header section height to "min height" and adjust it to your desired height.

Basically what happens is that the content of the header is "too tall" to shrink down anymore.

** Do I need Elementor Pro to use this plugin?**  
No, this plugin works perfectly with Elementor Free, If you are using Free Navigation Widget from The Plus Addons for Elementor. You’ll only need Elementor Pro if you're using Pro Navigation widgets.

** Is this a standalone plugin?**  
No, it requires Elementor Free or Pro. It extends Elementor’s functionality with new header scroll effects. 

** Where can I find the Sticky Header Effects settings?**  
Inside Elementor Editor → Select any container → Go to **Advanced Tab** → Scroll to **Sticky Header Effects** section.

** Will this plugin work with any WordPress theme?**  
Yes, it works seamlessly with most Elementor-optimized themes, including Hello, Nexter, Astra, and more.

** Will this slow down my website?**  
Not at all. It’s highly optimized for performance and coded lightweight to ensure fast page loads. It's lightest sticky header menu option with Google Page Speed optimized for top notch score.

This version adds "Sticky Header" and "Bottom Border" options.
The sticky feature will bring the section down and overlay it on top of the page. This eliminates the need for negative margins which causes page scrolling problems.
The bottom border feature adds bottom border width and color options when user scrolls.
